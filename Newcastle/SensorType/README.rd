## SpatialInequalityintheSmartCity
This folder contains the data and code to calculate the proportion of UO sensors broken down by sensor type in each IMD deprivation decile.

*Sensor locations:* A shapefile is included for each sensor type ([Air quality](https://github.com/CaitHRobinson/SpatialInequalityintheSmartCity/blob/master/Newcastle/SensorType/Sensors_AirQuality_Newcastle.zip), [Beehives](https://github.com/CaitHRobinson/SpatialInequalityintheSmartCity/blob/master/Newcastle/SensorType/Sensors_BeeHive_Newcastle.zip), [Noise](https://github.com/CaitHRobinson/SpatialInequalityintheSmartCity/blob/master/Newcastle/SensorType/Sensors_Noise_Newcastle.zip), [People](https://github.com/CaitHRobinson/SpatialInequalityintheSmartCity/blob/master/Newcastle/SensorType/Sensors_People_Newcastle.zip), [Traffic](https://github.com/CaitHRobinson/SpatialInequalityintheSmartCity/blob/master/Newcastle/SensorType/Sensors_Traffic_Newcastle.zip), [Vehicles](https://github.com/CaitHRobinson/SpatialInequalityintheSmartCity/blob/master/Newcastle/SensorType/Sensors_Vehicles_Newcastle.zip), [Water Level] (https://github.com/CaitHRobinson/SpatialInequalityintheSmartCity/blob/master/Newcastle/SensorType/Sensors_WaterLevel_Newcastle.zip), [Water quality](https://github.com/CaitHRobinson/SpatialInequalityintheSmartCity/blob/master/Newcastle/SensorType/Sensors_WaterQuality_Newcastle.zip), [Weather](https://github.com/CaitHRobinson/SpatialInequalityintheSmartCity/blob/master/Newcastle/SensorType/Sensors_Weather_Newcastle.zip)) accompanied by a csv. file detailing the LSOA that contain a sensor and their IMD classification.
