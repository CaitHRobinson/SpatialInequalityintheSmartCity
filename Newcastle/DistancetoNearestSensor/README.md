### Distance to nearest sensor

**Distance to Nearest Hub:** 
For the purpose of this analysis we used the [Population Weighted Centroids (PWC)](https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/datasets/b20460edf2f3459fa7d2771eacab51fc) for each LSOA in the dataset. PWC represent the spatial distribution of the population in each small area. For the purpose of this analysis we used the [Population Weighted Centroids (PWC)](https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/datasets/b20460edf2f3459fa7d2771eacab51fc) for each LSOA in the dataset. PWC represent the spatial distribution of the population in each small area. The [*Distance to Nearest Hub*]( https://gis4design.wordpress.com/2015/11/13/qgis-distance-to-nearest-hub/) tool in QGIS was used to calculate the nearest "hub", in this case air quality sensor, to each LSOA.

**Breakdown by socioeconomic datasets:** 
Average distances were calculated for a range of socioeconomic variables including deprivation, disability, ethnicity, private renting, social renting, young children and older age ([see full dataset for LSOA in England](https://github.com/CaitHRobinson/SpatialInequalityintheSmartCity/blob/master/Newcastle/DistancetoNearestSensor/SocioEconomic_LSOA_England.csv)). Details of each dataset is available from [NOMIS](https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/). In our analysis we [classified each variable into deciles](https://github.com/CaitHRobinson/SpatialInequalityintheSmartCity/blob/master/Newcastle/DistancetoNearestSensor/Ranking.rmd) relative to the rest of England. A [csv. file](https://github.com/CaitHRobinson/SpatialInequalityintheSmartCity/blob/master/Newcastle/DistancetoNearestSensor/SocioEconomic_AverageDistances_ByDecile.csv) contains a summary of the average distance to the nearest air quality sensor according to each variable. This can be used to [recreate Figure 3 using this code.](https://github.com/CaitHRobinson/SpatialInequalityintheSmartCity/blob/master/Newcastle/DistancetoNearestSensor/PolarPlots.rmd). Note, for the majority of the variables (with the exception of deprivation) the deciles are reversed in the latter spreadsheet (from 1-10 to 10-1) so that larger percentages according to each variable represent greater vulnerability.
