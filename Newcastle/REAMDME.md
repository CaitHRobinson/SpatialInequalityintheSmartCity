**Urban Observatory Sensor Locations:** Sensor locations are correct as of August 2020, but be aware that the sensor locations do change slightly (as sensors are de/commissioned). Shapefiles are provided for each sensor type in the analysis (air quality, beehives, noise, people, traffic, temperature, vehicles, water level, water quality). They are provided for the whole UO network aswell, as well as the Newcastle-upon-Tyne Local Authority (the focus on our analysis). A shapefile with all the sensor locations in the dataset is available here. More information, and the most recent sensor network, is available at the [UO website](https://urbanobservatory.ac.uk/).
