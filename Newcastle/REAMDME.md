**Urban Observatory sensor locations:** Sensor locations are correct as of August 2020, but be aware that the sensor locations do change slightly (as sensors are de/commissioned). Shapefiles are provided for [each sensor type](https://github.com/CaitHRobinson/SpatialInequalityintheSmartCity/tree/master/Newcastle/Sensors) in the analysis (air quality, beehives, noise, people, traffic, temperature, vehicles, water level, water quality). They are provided for the whole UO network aswell, as well as the Newcastle-upon-Tyne Local Authority (the focus on our analysis). More information, and the most recent sensor network, visit the [UO website](https://urbanobservatory.ac.uk/).
