# Newcastle Datasets

**Urban Observatory sensor locations:** Sensor locations are correct as of August 2020, but be aware that the sensor locations do change slightly (as sensors are de/commissioned). Shapefiles are provided for [each sensor type](https://github.com/CaitHRobinson/SpatialInequalityintheSmartCity/tree/master/Newcastle/Sensors) in the analysis (air quality, beehives, noise, people, traffic, temperature, vehicles, water level, water quality). They are provided for Newcastle-upon-Tyne Local Authority only (the focus on our analysis). For more information about individual sensors and data for the entire sensor network, visit the [UO website](https://urbanobservatory.ac.uk/).

# Newcastle descriptive analyses
This folder contains details of a three descriptive analyses building on these datasets: (1) by [sensor type and deprivation classification](https://github.com/CaitHRobinson/SpatialInequalityintheSmartCity/tree/master/Newcastle/SensorType), (2) by [distance to nearest sensor and socioeconomic variables](https://github.com/CaitHRobinson/SpatialInequalityintheSmartCity/tree/master/Newcastle/DistancetoNearestSensor), and (3) by [sensor coverage and internet user classification](https://github.com/CaitHRobinson/SpatialInequalityintheSmartCity/tree/master/Newcastle/InternetUsers).
