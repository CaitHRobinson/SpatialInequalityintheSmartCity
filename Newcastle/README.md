# Newcastle datasets
We explore the Newcastlecase study in greater detail through three descriptive analyses: (1) [sensor type and deprivation classification](https://github.com/CaitHRobinson/SpatialInequalityintheSmartCity/tree/master/Newcastle/SensorType), (2) [distance to nearest sensor and socioeconomic variables](https://github.com/CaitHRobinson/SpatialInequalityintheSmartCity/tree/master/Newcastle/DistancetoNearestSensor), and (3) [sensor coverage and internet user classification](https://github.com/CaitHRobinson/SpatialInequalityintheSmartCity/tree/master/Newcastle/InternetUsers).

**Urban Observatory sensor locations:** Sensor locations are correct as of August 2020, but be aware that the sensor locations do change slightly (as sensors are de/commissioned). Shapefiles are provided for [each sensor type](https://github.com/CaitHRobinson/SpatialInequalityintheSmartCity/tree/master/Newcastle/Sensors) in the analysis (air quality, beehives, noise, people, traffic, temperature, vehicles, water level, water quality). They are provided for Newcastle-upon-Tyne Local Authority only (the focus on our analysis). For more information about individual sensors and data for the entire sensor network, visit the [UO website](https://urbanobservatory.ac.uk/).

**Lower Super Ouput Area boundaries:** Our analysis is carred out at the [Lower Super Output Area (LSOA)](https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/geography/ukgeographies/censusgeographyhttps://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/geography/ukgeographies/censusgeography) scale representing approximately 1,500 persons.
