# Newcastle datasets
We explore the Newcastlecase study in greater detail through three descriptive analyses: (1) [sensor type and deprivation classification](https://github.com/CaitHRobinson/SpatialInequalityintheSmartCity/tree/master/Newcastle/SensorType), (2) [distance to nearest sensor and socioeconomic variables](https://github.com/CaitHRobinson/SpatialInequalityintheSmartCity/tree/master/Newcastle/DistancetoNearestSensor), and (3) [sensor coverage and internet user classification](https://github.com/CaitHRobinson/SpatialInequalityintheSmartCity/tree/master/Newcastle/InternetUsers).

**Urban Observatory sensor locations:** Sensor locations are correct as of August 2020, but be aware that the sensor locations do change slightly (as sensors are de/commissioned). Shapefiles are provided for [each sensor type](https://github.com/CaitHRobinson/SpatialInequalityintheSmartCity/tree/master/Newcastle/Sensors) in the analysis (air quality, beehives, noise, people, traffic, temperature, vehicles, water level, water quality). They are provided for Newcastle-upon-Tyne Local Authority only (the focus on our analysis). For more information about individual sensors and data for the entire sensor network, visit the [UO website](https://urbanobservatory.ac.uk/).

**Lower Super Ouput Area boundaries:** Our analysis is carred out at the [Lower Super Output Area (LSOA)](https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/geography/ukgeographies/censusgeographyhttps://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/geography/ukgeographies/censusgeography) scale representing approximately 1,500 persons. 

**Socio-economic data:** We combine sensor locations with socio-economic and demographic datasets, which are chosen to represent structural forms of disadvantage (e.g. racial inequality, income or deprivation) or physiological vulnerabilities to specific hazards (e.g. age-related); certain datasets reflect the inequality embedded in sensor technologies themselves (e.g. internet access). The list is not intended to be exhaustive but rather illustrative of the diversity of potential sensor deserts in different contexts.

For Newcastle, in addition to datasets derived from the [UK 2011 Census](https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/), two datasets merit further exploration. Firstly, the [English Indices of Multiple Deprivation (IMD)](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/english-indices-of-deprivation-2015) are a measure of relative deprivation calculated every five years that is well understood by policymakers. The IMD is comprised of seven domains assigned varying weights: Income, Employment, Disability and Health, Education and Skills, Barriers to Housing and Services, Living Environment and Crime (DCLG, 2015). Secondly, the [Internet User Classification (IUC)](https://data.cdrc.ac.uk/dataset/internet-user-classification) is a geodemographic indicator that describes how people interact with the internet (Alexiou and Singleton, 2018).
