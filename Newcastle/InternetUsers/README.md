## Sensor coverage and internet usage

**Internet user classification:** 
The [Internet User Classification (IUC)](https://data.cdrc.ac.uk/dataset/internet-user-classification) is a geodemographic indicator that describes how people interact with the internet (Alexiou and Singleton, 2018). The IUC is indicative of how confident communities are engaging with new technologies or accessing data. We analysed the number of LSOA in each IUC class that contained a sensor of any kind, to create Figure 4.
