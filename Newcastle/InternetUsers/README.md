## Sensor coverage and internet usage

**Internet user classification:** 
The [Internet User Classification (IUC)](https://data.cdrc.ac.uk/dataset/internet-user-classification) is a geodemographic indicator that describes how people interact with the internet (Alexiou and Singleton, 2018). The IUC is indicative of how confident communities are engaging with new technologies or accessing data.
