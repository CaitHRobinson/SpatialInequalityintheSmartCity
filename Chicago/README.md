# Chicago datasets 

**Array of Things sensor locations:** A point file for [Array of Things](https://arrayofthings.github.io/) sensor network complete as of March 2019 is available [here](https://github.com/CaitHRobinson/SpatialInequalityintheSmartCity/blob/master/Chicago/Chicago_SensorNodeLocations.shp.zip). This contains details about the precise locaton of each sensor. 

**Data from the Census:** Datasets are derived from the US 2010 census and the American Community Survey. More details about the specifics of the datasets is available via [IPUMS](https://usa.ipums.org/usa/) and in the methods section of the accompanying paper. The complete Census datasets for all Census Tracts in the USA are available for average [income](https://github.com/CaitHRobinson/SpatialInequalityintheSmartCity/blob/master/Chicago/USA_Tracts_IncomeandError.csv) and [African American population](https://github.com/CaitHRobinson/SpatialInequalityintheSmartCity/blob/master/Chicago/USA_Tracts_AfricanAmerican.csv). 

**Census Tract Boundaries:** Data is broken down by census tracts  that encompass between 2,500 and 8,000 people. A variety of different boundaries are included, one for each Census variable. This is because areas in which values for each variable was NULL were removed from the shapefile. A complete set of boundaries is available for [income](https://github.com/CaitHRobinson/SpatialInequalityintheSmartCity/blob/master/Chicago/Chicago_AllTractsWithout%20Nulls_Income.shp.zip) and [African American population](https://github.com/CaitHRobinson/SpatialInequalityintheSmartCity/blob/master/Chicago/Chicaco_AllTractsWithoutNulls_AfricanAmerican.shp.zip). Additionally a set of boundaries is included that contains only those tracts with a sensor for [income](https://github.com/CaitHRobinson/SpatialInequalityintheSmartCity/blob/master/Chicago/Chicago_AllTractsWithoutNulls_Sensor_Income.shp.zip) and [African American population](https://github.com/CaitHRobinson/SpatialInequalityintheSmartCity/blob/master/Chicago/Chicago_AllTractsWithoutNulls_Sensor_AfricanAmerican.shp.zip.). Summary satistics of these indicators (to create Figure 6 in the paper) can be found [here].
